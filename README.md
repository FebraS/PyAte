# PyAte (Python Authenticator Token Extractor)
PyAte is a lightweight and efficient Command-Line Interface (CLI) application built with Python. It serves as a powerful replacement for Google Authenticator, allowing you to manage and generate Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) directly from your terminal.

Instead of manually scanning QR codes, PyAte reads a list of `otpauth://` addresses from a text file (accounts.txt), making it easy to manage multiple accounts at once.

## ‚ú® Key Features
* **Multi-Account Support**: Manage all your TOTP accounts from one central place.

* **Clean CLI Display**: The terminal output automatically refreshes every 30 seconds to show a valid OTP code.

* **Dynamic Time Updates**: A countdown of the remaining time updates every second, providing an experience similar to the original app.

* **Automatic Copy**: The OTP code for the first account is automatically copied to your clipboard for easy pasting.

* **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

* **Migration Import**: Automatically imports all accounts from a Google Authenticator migration QR code, simplifying the setup process.

* **YubiKey Support**: Generates ykman commands directly from a migration URI, making it easy to import TOTP accounts to a YubiKey device.

* **Export to QR Codes**: **(New!)** Generates individual QR code images for accounts from a specified file, saving them to a qrcodes directory for backup or transfer.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
**1. Installation**
First, make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Setup**
Create a file named accounts.txt in the same directory as the program. Add the otpauth:// address for each of your accounts on a separate line.
Example accounts.txt content:

`otpauth://totp/GitHub:your-username?secret=ANOTHER_SECRET_KEY&issuer=GitHub`

**3. Run the Application**
Run the application with the basic command:

```bash
python pyate.py
```
This will display all your OTPs and automatically copy the first one to your clipboard.
